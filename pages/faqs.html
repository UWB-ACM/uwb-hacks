              <p>
                You do not need to have any prior coding experience. We are
                welcoming people of all experience and skill levels. Hackathons
                are a great opportunity to work with people of all skill levels.
                You will be able to look for team members in the hackathon
                discord or create a team of your own.

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">What are tracks?</button>
            <div class="faq-container">
              <p>
                In Hackathons, tracks are used to help you come up with ideas
                and help guide you through your project. For example: a project
                for the Connection track could be an app that helps students
                work more efficiently on group projects.

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">
              How will UWB Hacks from Home run remotely?

            <div class="faq-container">
              <p>
                We will be holding online events such as workshops and guest
                speakers through Zoom. You can refer to the event calendar for
                the specific event dates and times. For teamwork on your
                project, communication methods are entirely up to you, but we
                reccomend Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Discord.

            <div class="faq-container">
              <p>
                The short answer is yes. However, it is not required that you
                are a student from University of Washington Bothell. We are
                welcoming students from other universities, community colleges
                and high schools

              <p class="rule">Behave Appropriately:</p>
              <p>
                This is a school event, and thus you should act as you would on
                campus. Inappropriate behavior or posts are not acceptable under
                any circumstances.
              </p>
              <p class="rule">Keep Discussions On-Topic:</p>
              <p>
                Keep Discussions On-Topic: Please keep discussions relevant to
                the channel you are in. The '#off-topic' channel is available
                for whatever (appropriate) content you may wish to post/discuss.

            <div class="faq-container">
              <p>
                We have a limit of 5 members per team. Any more than 5 members
                would potentially reduce team production and cause further
                difficulties for your projects.

                You are welcome to work individually or with a team. If you are
                stuggling to find a team or don't have a team and want to work
                with one, we reccomend you join our UWB Hacks from Home
