                  a way to utilize the cloud to either educate young people
                  about sustainability or to build a sustainable solution and
                  help conserve energy, water, or other resources.

                  As the pandemic became a new normal for all of us, it left
                  lasting changes in our education system. Covid influenced the
                  use of new technology in education to help students continue
                  their education remotely. Think of ways to keep education
                  effective and available remotely, bonus points if you use a
                  cloud.
