## Development

You will need a SASS compiler. [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) on Visual Studio Code is the recommended plugin. As long as the SASS files are being converted to CSS, all you will need to do is open the main index.html file in your browser.
**You must commit these compiled CSS files among your changes.**

Be sure to enable the Live Sass compiler plugin by clicking the "Watch Sass" button.
